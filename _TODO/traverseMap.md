# Traverse a Map of Weighted Nodes

Start at a node, move to the next node of greater or equal weight, keeping a list of visited nodes. Do not revisit.

## Variations

* Move to weight that is less than or equal.
* If no node has greater weight, move to the highest weight less than or equal to current. Do not revisit.
* Randomly choose less than or greater than at each node. Do not revisit.
