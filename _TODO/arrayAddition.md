# Array Addition

This may be very simple in some (all?) the languages I am going to write in but I want to try it out anyway.

```python
[1, 2, 3] + ["one", "two", "three"] = [1, 2, 3, "one", "two", "three"]
```

This came about because appending to an array in a recursive function was producing nested arrays.
